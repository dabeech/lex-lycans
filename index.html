        <h2>Lexington Lycans and All American Karate Studio</h2>
        <p>Welcome, friend, to the martial way. Here you have a choice to make - do you take the path of open hand fighting, or the path of fully armored combat? Shotokan Karate or Buhurt? These two paths are both fulfilling in their own ways. If you choose the path of the open hand, Shotokan Karate, you will learn defense and discipline. If you choose the path of armored fighting, Buhurt, you will learn to fight with steel and board to take down your armored opponents. Either way, you will become stronger. Either way, you will find friends in this group to fight by your side. And if you can't choose one, you can always choose both.</p>
        <p>So what is it? Karate or armored combat? Scroll below for information.</p>
